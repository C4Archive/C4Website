Figuring out the state of the project...

content:
Essentially, what you see on this site (as of Nov'10), is a proof of concept, that can change radically to better meet the idea of "cocoa for artists".

For the moment, I've built the project to resemble @processing because it was easy, and because I really like their approach to teaching programming.

Below are parts of different conversations I've had regarding the project:

Please... email me if you have some comments: @email

<me>i'm starting this idea of doing cocoa for artists</me>

<somebody>what do you mean?</somebody>

<me>kinda like cocoa for scientists</me><br>
<me>but with more on the artistic side</me><br>
<me>some kind of mashup like processing meets cocoa for scientists</me>

<somebody>that could be interesting</somebody>

<me>i hope so</me>

<hr>

<somebody>I'm trying to decide how I feel about the setup/draw structure</somebody><br>
<somebody>...if there are reasons to deviate</somebody>

<me>actually, it was the easiest way to get started</me><br>
<me>totally open to rethink how it's structured</me></br>

<somebody>I don't like setup/draw because I feel like it cheats the user somehow</somebody><br>
<somebody>...preventing them from Â benefitting from nice platform features</somebody>

<somebody>They might work in OF or P5</somebody><br>
<somebody>...but you don't have to worry about being cross platform</somebody><br>

<me>how so?</me><br>
<me>setup is designed to be called at the end of the window's init function</me><br>
<me>...and draw gets called in drawRect:</me>

<somebody>Well, maybe I don't always want drawrect called.</somebody><br>
<somebody>Are you calling it with a timer or displaylink?</somebody>

<me>timer</me><br>
<me>i use a timer so that there's variable control over the framerate</me><br>
