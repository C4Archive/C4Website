title: Other Code
-
synopsis:
something completely boring here
-
content: 

While most of the code (and webstuff) in C4A is original, we're using a few additions:

@perlinnoise (although we did add @gcd threading to it...)

@staceyapp (the content management system for the site)

@syntaxhighlighter (for code coloring on the website)
