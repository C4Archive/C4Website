title: Move Above 
-
synopsis: This example illustrates a unique characteristic of movie objects by showing how to position one movie over top of another

Because movies are actually "layers" you can tell one to move over top of the other (and vice versa)

If there are many movies you can specify which layer you want a movie to draw into as well
-
shortsynopsis: puts one movie over top of another, based on mouse clicks

discussion: This is a further discussion about the example
